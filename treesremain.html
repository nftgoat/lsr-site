<h1>The Trees Will Remain</h1>
<br>
<h3>Description</h3>
<br>
<p>The <em>Trees Will Remain</em> celebrates the vibrant industry of life within the rolling
    green hills of Lake County, Florida. The poems are full of orchids and orange
    groves and lush heat and longing. They speak to the underrepresented population
    of migrant workers whose lives parallel the residents in seasons of want and of
    plenty. The earth is fertile here, but it is also rife with relics and ghosts. There is a
    bomb shelter beneath the orchards, and hot houses of conjured exotics. There
    are coyotes and hurricanes and fruits that hang “like little taunts” at the memory
    of venturers who lost it all in the citrus industry. But there is also an unbroken
    spirit here—“I can almost touch the veins of her.” Connected beneath us all, is an
    ancient aquifer, “a current braiding in the hollows.”</p>

    <br>
    <p>A heightened green, the eased inclines,</p>
    <p>an earth too damp to echo. Your words</p>
    <p>are safe here, this horizon’s seamless—</p>
    <p>horse, orchard, fence, palm tree; cumulus clouds</p>
    <p>so close you’ll witness their sticky lint inflections.</p>
    <p>Who knew stillness could be this porous,</p>
    <p>this immune to the leaching pitch of cicada.</p>
    <p>Bring apples for the horse. Along highway 441,</p>
    <p>trucks haul oranges and sod past roadside stands</p>
    <p>selling gator jerky and boiled peanuts. Strawberries</p>
    <p>blister into being. Gopher turtles tunneling in and out.</p>
    <p>You’ll find fossils in these hills, legacies of pioneers</p>
    <p>and Timucua, of bootleggers and soldiers, farmers</p>
    <p>and laborers. Ancient currents course beneath us</p>
    <p>in the limestone aquifer. There are ghosts</p>
    <p>in the groves, relics blown in by more than weather.</p>
    <p>Did you hear about the man who lost half his house</p>
    <p>to an eyewall wind, but a carton of eggs</p>
    <p>on the kitchen counter remained unbroken?</p>
    <p>There’s nothing fragile here beneath this green aura.</p>
    <p>In nurseries, orchids so intricate, they seem to have been</p>
    <p>plucked from beneath the skin, tweezered right out</p>
    <p>of the blood. Don’t touch them with your bare fingers.</p>
    <p>Each exquisite intrusion of stamen and sepal held up</p>
    <p>to the light and inhaled back inside through the lungs—</p>
    <p>pleural membranes, alveoli, follicle and inflorescence;</p>
    <p>humid things that needs no roots, so little light to breathe.</p>

    <p>Those small horns that root up</p>
    <p>and curl hard from your skull make me think</p>
    <p>of restless gods, of siren songs and beer cans</p>
    <p>tossed among the chickweed. Cloven sounds sacred.</p>

    <p>I have a feeling they would give me anything—</p>
    <p>bread, shoes, songs, forgiveness.</p>
    <p>Instead, they bring me cactus flowers &amp; orchids</p>
    <p>from the nurseries where they work,</p>
    <p>where they have grown hungry</p>
    <p>for a language that is not their own.</p>
    <br>
    <p>There’s more to this than a state of being:</p>
    <p>past, present, future. Tell me, what are your stories?</p>
    <p> <em>Angle</em> is the Creole word for English, and <em>medusa</em></p>
    <p>is Spanish for jellyfish— an asterisk tipped</p>
    <p>with electric barb that floats beneath the surface.</p>
    <p><em>Were</em> is a word that troubles them, and <em>through</em></p>
    <p>is an opening that’s hard to articulate.</p>
    <p>I want to tell them about poets and revolutionaries</p>
    <br>
    <p>who rose from the same fields of lath and linen,</p>
    <p>this scorch of citrus &amp; nettle &amp; yield. Mothers worry</p>
    <p>about writing letters to their children’s teachers,</p>
    <p>but dancing &amp; food are universal. Papaya, sugar,</p>
    <p>and water are all she needed, Carmela tells us,</p>
    <p>sharing her homemade candy. On my desk, they leave</p>
    <p>charms— roses and crucifixes woven from palmetto,</p>
    <p>origami cranes with red margin lines in their wings.</p>
    <br>
    <p><em>Last night, I wondered how many people</em></p>
    <p><em>were looking at the moon along with me,</em></p>
    <br>
    <p>writes Etienne in wide-eyed, schoolboy script.</p>
    <p>These new words between us, a scaffold of threads</p>
    <p>knotting the gridline of latitude to longitude,</p>
    <p>the same hard rib of the equator. Who knew that Archangels</p>
    <p>is a city on the White Sea, or that there are six thousand</p>
    <p>phrasings for moon— mwezi, luno, mond, lor; huo guo*</p>
    <br>
    <p>is the round rim we venture across with wooden sticks</p>
    <p>paired like quotation marks, dipping our offerings</p>
    <p>into the same seasoned essence— exotic new mouthfuls:</p>
    <p>mung bean, taro, lotus, bamboo shoot, am, is, are, because.</p>
    <br>
    <p>*huo guo is a Chinese fondu made with hot broth.</p>
