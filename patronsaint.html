<h1>To the Patron Saint of Wayward Daughters</h1>

<h3>Kelsay Books</h3>
<br>
<h4>Description</h4>
<br>
<p>This is a journey, an every-woman compilation that intrepidly explores both
    geographical landscapes and those of the heart. These poems are travel notes
    and tribal longings where “latitudes and longitudes (are) well-worn highways.” It’s
    a tale about women on the edge— of oceans and summits, reaching for the
    equator, or “riding on the back of an older boy’s motorcycle.” At times, one may
    fall, mesmerized while chasing a feather or for an unlikely lover, and another will
    soar, mermaid-like, “above the clutch of soft corals, …the open-mouthed kisses of
    fish.” Foreign countries echo with the footsteps of mothers and daughters who
    stir this collection in currents. Like any worthwhile journey, there is grief, wonder,
    and respites for introspection, but the trek remains buoyant alongside those
    “who don’t tilt toward the light/ but ache for the horizon instead.”</p>

      <p class="c"> like muses long given up their siren songs,</p> 
      <p class="c">  a paunchy silhouette of hip and bosom,</p>

        <h4>Reviews</h4>
        <br>
        <p>What Ross is doing here, it’s a cartography of womanhood, a chronicle of the
            feminine—water, blood, fear, longing—and it’s overwhelming. I feel like a voyeur,
            stirred by secrets I’ve overheard, my head buzzing and blooming, my heart
            cracked open like a pomegranate. What she shows us here is the long road from
            girl to woman to girl again, mothers’ and daughters’ journeys bouncing off each
            other like moonlight on the night sea. The girl on the cusp of womanhood, the
            woman in the eyes of the girl, the girl in the woman’s, the endless pull of moon
            and water, the ocean singing in our blood. I’m staggered by these poems.</p>
            <p>—John Calvin Hughes, author of<em> The Lost Gospel of Darnell Rabren</em></p>
            <br>
            <p>Laura Sobbott Ross’s sweeping and exultant book is both prayer and confession,
                an all-embracing utterance to a mythic, all-listening ear. These poems wrestle
                with the vagaries of life in a “praise song” of scintillating language and gasp-
                worthy images. In an odyssey across far-flung geography, yearning and memory,
                To the <em>Patron Saint of Wayward Daughters</em> is a poetic hero’s journey that startles,
                comforts and disquiets, but ultimately arrives as “small rainbowed forgivenesses”
                and an antidote for “the world and all its random cruelties.”</p>
                <p>—Gianna Russo, Wordsmith of the City of Tampa and author <em>of One House Down</em></p>
                <br>
                <p>In her latest offering, Laura Sobbott Ross gives us brilliant collection of poetry—
                    <em>To the Patron Saint of Wayward Daughters</em>, that has the genuine feel of a
                    culmination of lifelong journaling. Each page reflects on a past, brimming with
                    tales of family and friendship, love and longing, marinating in both melancholy—
                    my bones full of frolic despite the weight of your doctor’s prognosis, and
                    celebration—<em> I wanted to dance with you, Barcelona, your candles gone liquid,
                    your blue twilight under lace. This is impactful, revealing verse</em>— the soft belly of a
                    well-lived life, detailing adventures that circle the globe. Laura holds nothing back.
                    When you close this book, you’ll know her better.</p>

                <h6 class="b">Wine with Everything Was What I Said</h6>
                <br>
                <p>when someone would ask me</p>
                <p>for the color of my lipstick.</p>
                <p>I loved the way it made me feel</p>
                <p>like a mad queen issuing a proclamation—</p>
                <p><em>Wine with Everything</em> and enough</p>
                <p>roasted squab for all the rowdy villagers;</p>
                <p>a festival of plums & harlequin roses—</p>
                <p>that color, I mean, the way it never bled</p>
                <p>in betrayal across my teeth. <em>Amative—</em></p>
                <p>(disposed to love), the gist of a shade</p>
                <p>too kitten heeled and pearly for me,</p>
                <p>a shimmer lifted away by the wind</p>
                <p>while riding on the back of an older boy’s</p>
                <p>motorcycle when you were supposed to be</p>
                <p>home babysitting your younger brother.</p>
                <p><em>Mars Rising</em>, a chroma too atmospheric</p>
                <p>not to leave what looked like a trail of blood</p>
                <p>across throats and earlobes, and let me just say</p>
                <p><em>Desire Was a Blue-Eyed Man</em>, silky & humid</p>
                <p>a taste that really left me wanting</p>
                <p>to be kissed down there by the river</p>
                <p>before I learned <em>Crush</em> was a color</p>
                <p>that meant avalanche, matte and opaque,</p>
                <p>too heavy for a girl revved up on Revlon,</p>
                <p>a girl too impractical to sustain</p>
                <p>the momentum of anything but dancing,</p>
                <p>who thought there was nothing more</p>
                <p>hypnotic than moonlight darkening the hollows</p>
                <p>of a man’s cheekbones. I tried them all—</p>
                <p>by that I mean the lipstick shades, of course—</p>
                <p>the orchids and the mochas and the corals,</p>
                <p>the lacquered, the frosted, the ticklish feather coats</p>
                <p>of glossy nudes, the amber-golds and apricots— all</p>
                <p>imprints ghosting from goblets raised in the palette</p>
                <p>cleansing light between him and him and him;</p>

                <br>
                <p>I left you too soon, Barcelona,</p>
                <p>your stone hillside of petulant angels,</p>
                <p>your iron tatted balconies, your cinnamon</p>
                <p>haze, your spires &amp; cannons &amp; crypts.</p>
                <p>The sudden flame of bougainvillea,</p>
                <p>mouthy and righteous. Everything: a dare.</p>
                <p>A whim. A hemline whipping &amp; brambled.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I wanted to dance with you, Barcelona,</p>
                <p>your candles gone liquid, your blue</p>
                <p>twilight under lace, your tavern wine,</p>
                <p>your velvet skirts combed humid</p>
                <p>with summer, your red mouth lit</p>
                <p>with saffron &amp; clove, that mesmerizing,</p>
                <p>crooked eye tooth when you laugh.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I wanted to eat with you, Barcelona,</p>
                <p>tapas &amp; cava &amp; mocha. Your city side,</p>
                <p>a broken dragon husked and draped</p>
                <p>to a whip blue sea. At the open window,</p>
                <p>a sequin catching on a rim so fine it wails.</p>
                <p>Truffle. Cuttlefish. Artichoke. Aubergine.</p>
                <p>Bobal wicking purple on white linen.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I wanted to walk with you, Barcelona,</p>
                <p>along your mosaic curbs of grouted confetti,</p>
                <p>your spiral-shell walls of sea-whisper,</p>
                <p>your Roman stanchions of blood &amp; pig &amp; sweat.</p>
                <p>In your marketplaces, candy-bright produce,</p>
                <p>beggars &amp; pickpockets, splays of dawn</p>
                <p>colored lilies razored against fortress walls.</p>
                <br>
                <p>And, I wanted to feel you, Barcelona,</p>
                <p>your bedsheets, and your tambourine moon,</p>
                <p>your flamenco tide rattling hulls &amp; shutters,</p>
                <p>your wolf &amp; leather scented wind, your stars</p>
                <p>sliding hot into grottos, the way the harbor</p>
                <p>pivots, lights the column line of date palms,</p>
                <p>and opens the soft, willing throats of doves.</p>
