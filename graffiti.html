<h1>The Graffiti of Pompeii</h1>
<br>
<br>
<h5>Description</h5>
<br>
<p>Inspired by actual graffiti unearthed from the ancient city of Pompeii, these
    poems are a diverse series of vignettes that flesh out the characters and
    backstories. Just like the voices of the graffiti writers themselves, the poems
    assume different tones, moods, and perspectives. These ancient words still taunt,
    lament, provoke, philosophize, and astound. Many are simple, timeless messages
    of the self: “Antiochus hung out here with his girlfriend Cythera” or “Come drink
    with us, Oceanus.” Connecting the words between the writers and their readers
    across centuries, The Graffiti of Pompeii reveals how alike we are and how time
    does little to alter our basic humanity.</p>

    <h5>Reviews</h5>
    <br>
    <p>Ross’s language “swallow(s)/ us in like dizzied bees,” at times, intoxicatingly,
        synaesthetically lyrical, at times, winkingly devolving into mathematical
        tabulations, crosswords, and other wordplay in an exhilarating quest to utter life’s
        unutterable multiplicity. Graffiti is, when you get down to it, a reaching toward
        immortality, an effort to take sanctuary in the permanence of the written word. In
        these erudite, character-rich linked lyrics, Ross brings a novelist’s keen powers of
        psychological penetration to bear, resurrecting the doomed dwellers of Pompeii,
        prostitutes and confirmed bachelors, slaves and slave-owners, arguing that just as
        these motley people once attracted Vesuvius’s dark attention, they now merit
        ours: their graffiti shows them to have been bawdy, boastful, and blindly desirous,
        cruelly hedonistic and savagely carefree, but they were also human in the same
        timeless ways we are, and they were once— albeit briefly— “enviously alive.”</p>

        <p>a pitcher of wine and a drinking goblet)</p>
        <br>
        <h6>Whoever wants to serve themselves can</h6>
        <h6>go on and drink from the sea</h6>
        <br>
        <p>This wine’s cut with water. In Pythagorean proportions.</p>
        <p>Let all the Greeks raise their goblets.</p>
        <p>Hail to mathematical scholars.</p>
        <p>To the greatest philosophers. To architectural splendors.</p>
        <p>Only barbarians drink undiluted wine.</p>
        <p>Let all the Thracians raise their goblets.</p>
        <p>Hail to everything beautifully uncivilized.</p>
        <p>To the gods who likewise need no dilutions.</p>
        <p>Romans have the most enchanting whores.</p>
        <p>Let the Gauls raise their goblets.</p>
        <p>And the Scythians. And the Thracians.</p>
        <p>And the Germanians. And the Celts. Hail</p>
        <p>to dice rolls and scattered knucklebones. Cast my lots.</p>
        <p>Bring me olives and bread. No tantrum</p>
        <p>or bloodied fist will land you</p>
        <p>double sixes, Inebrius— only Venus herself,</p>
        <p>but not in this reeking Hades.</p>
        <p>Leave your empty amphoras on Neptune’s</p>
        <p>altar, your crockery and bronze.</p>
        <p>This barmaid’s sending us down to the sea.</p>
        <p>Maybe the mermaids will satisfy your fetish</p>
        <p>for fish, Tyberius. But, be wary:</p>
        <p>that fermented mullet sauce in your beard will draw sharks.</p>
        <p>Those floating lanterns of jellyfish</p>
        <p>are Medusas with electric hair.</p>
        <p>You can paw the sand over your</p>
        <p>defecations like a cat, Marcellus.</p>
        <p>Your gonads will float like an avocet.</p>
        <p>The sea is a great equalizer,</p>
        <p>Quintus, no, not a great elixir.</p>
        <p>Leave some coins by these drained goblets,</p>
        <p>lest we wake tomorrow on the rasping beach pebbles,</p>
        <p>with seawater, sharp and scolding, on our shriveled tongues.</p>

        <h6>leaving me all alone like this.</h6>
        <br>
        <p>Everything has an epicenter,</p>
        <p>a single point of origination</p>
        <p>from which an impetus keens</p>
        <p>open, chases itself in ripples that cease</p>
        <p>to touch until they are dead as foam—</p>
        <p>a tremble disassembling. See this town</p>
        <p>square, these men and women navigating</p>
        <p>in folds— tunic and familia, both</p>
        <p>a tight weaving of threads. Look</p>
        <p>at the faces of the crowd. Can you see</p>
        <p>a howl gone dormant in their molars?</p>
        <p>The instinct for flesh. To lie down next to</p>
        <p>To penetrate. To be penetrated by.</p>
        <p>These mountains are god-fisted. The sea</p>
        <p>teems with a mercurial underpinning,</p>
        <p>and at that shop I can buy seven</p>
        <p>different kinds of olives, and at this one,</p>
        <p>leather to lace my hobnailed soles.</p>
        <p>No pole star necessary; I am oceaned</p>
        <p>with humanity and imperatives.</p>
        <p>If I let go of this stone door well,</p>
        <p>I will swirl and eddy into the drift.</p>
        <p>But loneliness, Sarra?</p>
        <p>It is marrowed inside of us like air.</p>
